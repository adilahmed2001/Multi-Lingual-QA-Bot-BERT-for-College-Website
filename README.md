# Multilingual-Q-A-Bot-for-College-Website-using-BERT
**The proposed system is a multilingual chatbot that leverages a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on a labeled dataset in English. The dataset, created using information from the MVSR College website, consists of context, questions, and corresponding answers.

To enable multilingual support, a translation module is integrated into the system. When a user submits a query in a language other than English, the module translates it into English. This translated query is then processed by the fine-tuned BERT model, which extracts the relevant answer span from the context. The output is subsequently translated back into the user's original language.

The chatbotâ€™s user interface and backend are built using Python's Flask web framework.**
